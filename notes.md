# Intro
not a transpo or any  sort of public policy guy, just a techie who loves bikes &  maps

# What is it?

# History
Started on FxOS. What could I make that was missing.

FFWD Why keep giong, Transit does all of them and way more!

Transit didn't when I started.

Transit is iOS & Android only. This is about the most cross platform you can get.

# Demo!
How many people here rode a bikeshare here?

# Architecture
A little bit about how this works from a high level.

Deployed using the serverless framework to AWS Lambda and S3.

The browser fetches static assets from S3.

The scripts use leaflet to make a map

The scripts fetch JSON from the lambda proxy for each provider

JUMP has CORS
